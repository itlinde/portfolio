        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>I'm second year integrated engineering student at UBC aiming to specialize in computer engineering and computer science. I'm passionate about front-end software development, and producing well-designed products that feel smooth, clean, and effortless.</p>
        <p>Some technology I've been using recently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Swift & SwiftData</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outside of classes and personal projects, I'm a cozy game enthusiast who loves filmmaking, photography, art, and live music.</p>
